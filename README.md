### üëã Hi there

I'm Victor and my purpose in life is to serve. Whether that be my family, team members, employer or the customer. In my professional capacity I serve using my **15 years experience** in **strategic operations planning**. Based in New York City, I am passionate about using **Data Science** to provide **business insghts** and **optimize operations**. My skillset is:
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Excel

In time I will add to this with more side projects culminating with a multi tier probabilistic supply chain optiization model using computational design.
